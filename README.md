Run backend in the server/ directory : First run "mvn compile" to compile then "mvn exec:java" to run in terminal  <br/>
&emsp; The Backend uses: JDK, Maven, and SQLite  <br>
&emsp;&emsp; I am using Apache Maven 3.9.9, Java version: 17.0.4.1, sqlite3: 3.39.5(Check pom.xml in server for other dependencies)  <br>
Run frontend in the client/ directory: "npm start"  <br>
